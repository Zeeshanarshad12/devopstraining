# Agile vs DevOps
In Agile application development is done in sprints instead of Waterfall model, with small teams
DevOps approach ensure that code and infrastructure are always in a deployable state
#Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment
Contineous Integration ensure that every check-in is build automatically and notify dev team incase build fails so application code is in deployable state
Contineous delivery required manual steps before deploying to production environment or any ohter stage
In Contneous Deployment every succesfull build is deployed to production environment directly it doesn,t involve manual approval
